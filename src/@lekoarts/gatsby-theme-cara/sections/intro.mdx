# Hi,
You probably came to me.

I am Tal Cohen with extensive knowledge in the field of computers and psychology, I have always dreamed of finding the combination of the two fields, on the one hand implementing technological innovation in various projects and on the other finding a user experience that works on principles of comfort, visibility, simplicity, speed, continuous improvement. Thanks.
